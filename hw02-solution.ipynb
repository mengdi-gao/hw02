For example, some ballots may be accepted in 2020 but not in previous elections. \n",

    "    According to paragraph 15, Cicchetti suggested that the first 95% voters and the last 5% voters should be random samples from the same population of all votes cast.

    "    \n",
    "    For paragraph 11 and 12, the outcomes were based on an assumption that everything is similar as Biden and Clinton are both Democract candidates. However, it's possible that people who voted for Trump over Clinton in 2016 choose to vote for Biden in 2020 after Trump's four-year presidential term. It's also possible that Biden has more supporter than Clinton or most of the new voters from 18 to 22 support Biden over Trump.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    According to paragraph 15, even if the null hypothesis is false, it might due to the fact that the last 5% yet-to-count ballots are mail-in ballots. People who vote by mail could be very different from people who vote inperson, and the former may be more likely to support Biden. Moreover, Cicchetti does not remove the effect of the difference in the decrease number of votes (i.e. he compares 95% voters to 5% voters without adjusting for the difference in the number of votes). I reproduce his result and a result that reduce the effect as shown below. "

    "To begin with, Cichetti's Z-tests do not met all the assumptions, and it makes his conclusion less persuasive. For example, we cannot assume that votes are independent as many factors can affect how people vote in election. Moreover, some of his tests are not consistent. For example, in paragraph 11, he does not consider the effect of the difference in the increase/ decrease number of votes; he explains the effect of the difference and removes it in the hypothesis for paragraph 12. However, in paragraph 15, he does not adjust for the difference in the number of votes without mentioning it. As shown in 2.1, his action gives us a much greater test statistics, 1891, instead of 252. Hence, his analysis is not rigorous enough and it may weaken his conclusion. "

    "I think Cicchetti's argument is not strong. First of all, Cichetti's Z-tests do not met all the assumptions, and it weakens his conclusion. Besides, even if his null hypotheses are false, it does not necessarily mean that the reported results in Georgia are wrong. For example, people who vote by mail could be very different from people who vote inperson. As stated by many politicians and media, voters who supported Democrats were more likely to choose mail-in ballots. Therefore, it's possible that votes tabulated before November 4 at 3:10 AM EST and votes tabulated from November 4 3:10 AM EST to November 18 2:00 PM EST are not random samples from the same population. However, it doesn't mean that the results in Georgia are wrong."
