# Stat 159/259 Homework Assignment

This course uses [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/42591242-stat-159-259-spring-2021-university-of-california-berkeley) to manage assignments. 

In general the workflow for you will be the same for all assignments (we'll update this document as we refine the process and learn new details):

- You will be given a special URL to start the assignment. 

- That link lets you create a new repository from our template, containing this README file with general instructions, plus the specifics of the given assignment.

- You will work in your repository, alone or in teams (depending on whether it's an individual or group assignment).  You will push your changes to the repository, adding new files, images, etc, to meet the requirements of the assignment.

- Your _entire submission_, unless otherwise stated, will be done through the repository.  We (the instructors) will download all your work as a repository and will evaluate it there.

- You can continue making changes and pushing new work up until the deadline, time at which GitHub will not let you push further changes. We encourage you to work incrementally and push even partial work. That also makes it easier for you to ask for help on work-in-progress.
